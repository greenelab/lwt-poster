# VINCE

## methods

auto cite process: plugin architecture, use of manubot, metasources

complex flowchart of github actions workflows. deploy previews, custom actions

stretching the limits of jekyll, like list component with filtering with ruby expressions, more flexible, terse, readable than liquid syntax

dockerization for consistency across platforms

# FAISAL

i know i'm not dave, but imo the poster sells lab website template as a tool for producing polished sites for academic users, and all the figures (which are cool, by the way) are talking about its adoption and maintenance track record, not its technical merits. i can appreciate why the reviewers mentioned that, as it's presented, it's not of as much interest to software developers, the audience of the conference. i think there's a lot going on technically with lab-website-template that would be of interest to software devs, like how it's entirely implemented on github and uses some imho advanced features, like template repos, but imo you don't see it in the poster.

fwiw, i think that does come through in the charts, and i think it's a convincing and good argument to make. unfortunately for software devs the story of your software's success and the effort it took to get there might be less interesting than the technical bits. i wouldn't drop those charts, but if you were to revise it i'd maybe add a graphic that's not a plot where you, say, show how the software runs on github

# DAVE

I liked what Faisal had to mention, maybe talking through what the typical workflow would look like. You could also show how LWT solves a business problem too; saving time and money for others. Our own SET website use of the work shows that it need not be only PI's or non-technical folks who use the platform (anyone can benefit). Maybe diving into the future could help too; like what you see as the next evolution of the software or how the domain is changing and what LWT will do to meet that change.

# REVIEWERS

This poster will present a new tool and template for establishing research group websites. The submission fits within the Code and Practices themes by presenting a resource to help RSEs and their teams better promote their work. The concept of web site templates and generators for academic purposes is not new. However, the authors state that they aim to distinguish this toolâ€™s utility from the myriads of website templates or generators by enabling easier setup and use by non-technical users. Their example of streamlined citation generation for an academic site is interesting. Overall, the work seems likely to be of at least some interest to many conference attendees who likely face the need to maintain a web presence.

I think this submission could greatly benefit researchers who need to display their lab and its work. Also, its use of Manubot to create citations is uniquely suited for the convention audience. However, such standardized templates such as these seem targeted towards non-technical researchers, which may not be as engaging for technical research software engineers. The submission does adhere well to the theme of code, practices, and people, and may benefit from an open discussion and new developers who may improve the template further.
